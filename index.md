### Neural Network from scratch (no ML library used)

First serious ML project for understanding neural network inner workings and learning to implement in python. Used this to test the _hello world_ problem of neural networks classification, recognizing hand-written digits from the MNIST database. Following are the highlights from the project:

- Implemented _Layer_ class in python for _activation_ and _backpropogation_.
- Icorporated _Adam optimzer_ to the _backpropogation_ update procedure.
- Results of the code showed comparable accuracy on test data using a _Tensorflow_ model of same architecture.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/td-iceman/Tarandeep-Projects/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
