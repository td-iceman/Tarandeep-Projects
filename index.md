## Data and Machine Learning Projects

### Neural Network from scratch    &emsp; [github](https://github.com/td-iceman/Tarandeep-Projects/blob/main/NN%20from%20scratch/NN_from_scratch.ipynb)

Hands-on ML project for understanding neural network inner workings and learning to implement in python. Used this to test the _hello world_ problem of neural networks classification, recognizing hand-written digits from the MNIST database. Following are the highlights from the project:

- Implemented _Layer_ class in python for _activation_ and _backpropogation_.
- Incorporated _Adam optimizer_, _sigmoid_ activation function, _mean square error_ cost function and _mini-batch_ training method.
- 15 neuron hidden layer network classified 90 % digits correctly (tensorflow: 94 %)

### Heart Disease prediction - Kaggle dataset     &emsp; [github]()

Took open data for heart patients from Kaggle datasets and trained various decision tree-based classification models. Also used SHAP model explainer to the best model to develop data insights for prediction.
